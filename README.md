This repository contains my personal writeups and notes for labs completed on the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).
Each lab includes an explanation of the vulnerability, tools used, and exploitation techniques.

Periodically I will return to the laboratories and machines I have completed and make any changes or improvements to my solutions.
